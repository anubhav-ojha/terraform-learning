# ðŸ§± What is IaC (Infrastructure as Code)?

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure (like servers, networks, databases, etc.) using code instead of manual processes.

## ðŸ’¡ Think of it like this:

Traditionally, if you wanted to set up a server, you'd:
- Log into the cloud providerâ€™s web console (e.g., AWS Console).
- Click buttons to launch instances, set up networks, etc.

With IaC, you:
- Write code (in YAML, JSON, HCL, etc.) that describes your infrastructure.
- Run that code to automatically create and manage the infrastructure.

## âœ¨ Key Features of IaC

| Feature           | Why It Matters                                       |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Automation**     | No more manual setup â€” run code, get infra!          |
| **Consistency**    | Same code = same setup every time.                   |
| **Version Control**| Store infra in Git â€” rollback or review changes.     |
| **Collaboration**  | Teams can review, reuse, and improve code.           |
| **Speed**          | Quickly spin up infrastructure in minutes.           |
